# ShopApp

This my first app (WPF/C#) witch is connected with data base with Entity Framework. 
Creating this app was inspired by similar apps witch are used by cashiers in Shops. It's still educational and training but could
be used in Shops. I wanted to keep functionality as best as I can. If you have any comments please contact with me.
Let's see below to screenshots of App:
